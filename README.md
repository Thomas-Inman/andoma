# â™Ÿ Andoma

A chess engine called _Andoma_ (after its authors _Andrew_ and _Roma_).

It implements:
- [Alpha-beta pruning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning) for move searching
- [Move ordering](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Move_Ordering) based off heuristics like captures and promotions
- Tomasz Michniewski's [Simplified Evaluation Function](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Simplified_Evaluation_Function) for board evaluation and piece-square tables
- A slice of the Universal Chess Interface (UCI) to allow challenges via lichess.org

<br>

An example interaction with the engine (responses are commented):

```bash
uci
# id name Andoma
# id author Andrew Healey & Roma Parramore
# uciok
position startpos moves e2e4
go
# bestmove g8f6
```

<br>

## Lichess.org

The UCI protocol slice that's implemented by this engine means you can play it via lichess.org by using [ShailChoksi/lichess-bot](https://github.com/ShailChoksi/lichess-bot) (a bridge between Lichess API and chess engines) and a BOT account.

<br>

## Development

Start the engine with:

`python run main.py`

<br>

## Tests

There are unit tests for the engine and the evaluation module:

`python -m unittest discover test/`
